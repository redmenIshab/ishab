  roleDescription:
    "With my 6+ years engineering journey, I've discovered that mastering both technical and people skills is what truly sets senior engineers and leaders apart.\nThe hard skills are the foundation.With deep expertise in system design to build scalable architectures. I've tackled complex database optimization challenges that improved server performance by 40%. Working with AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes taught me how critical modern cloud infrastructure is for delivering reliable solutions.\nBut here's what most engineers overlook and I did too (learned it in a hardway): technical excellence alone isn't enough. Leading engineering teams taught me that soft skills drive the biggest impact. Clear communication helps align stakeholders. Strong mentorship accelerates junior developers' growth. Effective problem-solving and collaboration turn challenging projects into successful deployments.\nI learned this firsthand while building a hospitality tech startup. My technical skills helped architect the solution, but it was the ability to prioritize features, manage competing demands, and guide the team that brought vision to life.",
